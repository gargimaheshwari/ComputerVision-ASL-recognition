# Deep Learning for ASL recognition

In this notebook I use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze and recognize Americal Sign Language letter symbols.

I begin by loading the data, displaying the images and preprocessing them. I then form a deep learning model with over 1 million parameters and test it on two different sets of data.

Finally, I use the model to plot confusion matrices for both sets of testing data, which show a wealth of information about the workings of the deep learning model.
